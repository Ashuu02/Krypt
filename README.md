# Krypt

## Hello folks!! </br>
🎯I just created my first project in Web3 domain. 😁 </br>
🎯The app is ## **_Krypt_**.... </br>
🎯It's a **Crypto Wallet**- An individual can make secure transactions using the app. All he/she needs is address of the receiver and a personal metamask account. </br>
🎯It's a **Decentralized App**(DApp) - The wallet is not controlled by any particular organization or government. It is transaparent, secure and reliable.</br>
🎯It's completely **responsive** and is built using **React** libraby of JS.</br>
🎯It transfers **Ethereum** (test/real time) over other addresses anywhere in the world. </br> 


</br>
📌This was my first project using **_Solidity_**. 🤩 </br>
📍Solidity language is used to write _**Smart Contracts**_ which are later deployed on the different blockchain networks.(here i've used _**Goerli Test Network**_ over **Alchemy** platform). </br>
📌I've used _**tailwind-css**_ for styling this app. </br>
📍Tailwind provides us with off-the-peg css classes directly and makes the project styling trouble-free, although i had some issue with Responsiveness of the site in the beginning, but later the issue was resolved.  </br>
📌I used **Remix IDE** to create my ContractABI and ContractAdress.
<br>
📍**Remix IDE** really makes Smart-Contract deployment over Blockchain **hassle-free** and **quick**. I would always recommend it over **_VS code_** for this task.👀 </br>
📌The only downside is that you must have a **metamask account** to make any transactions and see the later process.😐 </br>
....Here's the link to video to watch transactions happening through the app.  </br> 
📌I've used **_Giphy Developers API_** to produce the Gif. 🚀</br>
📍After a successful transfer of crypto is made it will render the transaction details at the bottom of the page along with a Gif related to the **message** you passed.👻  </br>
