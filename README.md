# Krypt

## Hello folks!! </br>
🎯I have created a my first ever **Decentralized Web3 App**. </br>
🎯The app is **_Krypt_**....It's a Crypto Wallet. </br>
🎯It transfers Cryto amount (test or real time) over other addresses anywhere in the world. </br> 
</br>
📌This was my first project using **_Solidity_** and **_Smart Contracts_**.  </br>
📌The only downside is that you must have a **metamask account** to make any transactions and see the later process.  </br>
....Here's the link to video to watch transactions happening through the app.  </br>
📌I've used _**tailwind-css**_ for styling this app. It has provided me with simple inline styled css and made the project work trouble-free, although i had some issue with Responsiveness of the site in the beginning, but later the issue was resolved.  </br>
📌I used **Remix IDE** to create my ContractABI and ContractAdress.
📍**Remix IDE** really makes Smart-Contract deployment over Blockchain **hassle-free** and **quick**. I would always recommend it over _VS code_ for this task.👀 </br>
📍After a successful transfer of crypto is made it will render the transaction details at the bottom of the page along with a Gif related to the message you passed.  </br>
The Gif is by **_Giphy Developers API_**. </br>
