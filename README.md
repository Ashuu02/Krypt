# Krypt

##Hello folks!! </br>
I have created a my first ever **Decentralized Web3 App**. </br>
The app is **_Krypt_**....It's a Crypto Wallet. </br>
It transfers Cryto amount (test or real time) over other addresses anywhere in the world. </br>
This was my first project using _Solidity_ and _Smart Contracts_.  </br>
The only downSide is that you must have a **metamask account** to make any transactions and see the later process,  </br>
Here's the link to video to watch transactions happening through the app.  </br>
I've used _**tailwind-css**_ here. It has provided me with simple inline styled css and made the project work trouble-free, although i had some issues with Responsiveness of the site in the beginning, but later the issue was resolved.  </br>
I used **Remix IDE** to create my ContractABI and ContractAdress.
**Remix IDE** really makes Smart-Contract deployment over Blockchain **hassle-free** and **quick**. I would always recommend it over _VS code_.
After a successful transfer of crypto is made it will render the transaction details at the bottom of the page along with a Gif related to the message you passed.  </br>
The Gif is by _Giphy Developers API_. </br>
