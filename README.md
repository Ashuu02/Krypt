# Krypt

Hello folks!!
I have created a my first ever Decentralized Web3 App.
This app is a Crypto Wallet.
It transfers Cryto amount (test or real time) over other addresses anywhere in the world.
This was my first project using Solidity and Smart Contracts. 
The only downSide is that you must have a metamask account to make any transactions and see the later process, 
Here's the link to video to watch transactions happening through the app.
I've used tailwind-css here. It has provided me with simple inline styled css and made the project work trouble-free, although i had some issues with Responsiveness of the site in the beginning, but later the issue was resolved.
I used Remix IDE to create my ContractABI and ContractAdress.
Remix IDE really makes Smart-Contract deployment over Blockchain hassle-free and quick. I would always recommend it over VS code.
